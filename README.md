I wrote out a fully detailed report of my methods and learnings [here](https://github.com/harishasan001/data-sci-portfolio/blob/main/NYC%20Taxi%20Fare%20Prediction%20Report%20%2B%20Explanation.pdf) where I explain my thoughts alongside the code. It's quite long so here are some screenshots that should serve well as a TL;DR:

## üìî Can we use meeting notes to identify the best clients?
#### Data Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining
##### Languages/tools used: MS Azure, Excel, R

The goal was to consider what kind of insights we can get from meeting notes between the business and clients. It was important for us to figure out what kinds of words could suggest high sales potential.

We manually went through 800 comments from meeting notes over about 8 weeks, rating them in 5 different categories

Then we analyzed the key phrases and sentiments using Microsoft Azure, and compared the results with what we found in our manual analysis.

Finally, we used the sales data to determine the correlation between the sales and dimension scores, and found the correlation coefficient for each of the five categories to reach our conclusions.

  </kbd></p>


***Results***
<br>
We realized that Account Penetration was perhaps the most important Dimension Score because it demonstrated the greatest Correlation Coefficient.

Practically, this means that High Penetration phrases such as ‚ÄúMet with Dr", "met with doc‚Äù, ‚ÄúMet with office manager‚Äù, ‚Äúmet with OM‚Äù, ‚ÄúInterested‚Äù, etc. may result in greater Total Sales in the past, present and future.

We achieved the highest standard for our analysis work and presentation.

## üìâ What can we learn from crypto stock data?
#### Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization
##### Languages/tools used: Python: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Here, I took the live price data of the top ten crypto stocks from Yahoo finance and sought to answer some questions as I explored it. 
- What's the change in the stock's price over time?
- What was the moving average of various stocks?
- What was the daily return average of a stock?
- What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
  -  This one was particularly interesting to me. Here's the heatmap visualization that proved to be quite insightful:
<br><kbd><img src="crypto stock correlation.PNG" width="365" height="416"></kbd></br>
- How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
  - This too provided some intriguing insight, which I'll highlight here:
<br><kbd><img src="Crypto stock risk.PNG"></kbd></br>
- Can we attempt to predict future stock behaviour?
  - Here I implemented the Monte Carlo method to predict the stock price of Coinbase. 
<br><kbd><img src="crypto stock prediction.PNG"></kbd></br>
  - However, I am wary of this method as the final result intuitively feels highly improbable. The value of crypto stock often seems to be tied closely with culture which is something very difficult to account for in simulations and predictions. Perhaps accounting for cultural sentiment in stock value predictions is a data science project worth exploring itself?

## üß† How can I best condense millions of data points across many different files? 
#### Data Manipulation
##### Languages/tools used: Python: Pandas

I had the opportunity to work as a research intern in a psychology laboratory for an academic year at Purdue and this was one of the projects that I worked on.

Here, I combined 10+ .csv files that contained millions of points of raw data we had captured from live EEG experiments. I was able to create a database that was easy to look at and straightforward to work with for any subsequent tasks.


## üò∑ How can we use COVID-19 survey data to identify good investments?
#### Data Analysis, Business Application
##### View my full project presentation [here](https://github.com/harishasan001/data-sci-portfolio/blob/main/COVID-19%20Data%20Investment%20Project%20_%20Haris%20Hasan.pdf)


Took a COVID-19 survey data dashboard and extensively analysed data points to identify investment oppportunities.

Subsequently justified a novel hypothesis for investment into artificial-intelligence-based hiring technologies with a focus on rehiring opportunities.

My partner and I were fortunate to achieve the highest grade standard for our analysis work and presentation.
