#### End-to-End ML model: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Supervised Linear Regression Model
##### Languages/tools used: Python: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
I wrote out a fully detailed report of my methods and learnings [here](https://github.com/harishasan001/data-sci-portfolio/blob/main/NYC%20Taxi%20Fare%20Prediction%20Report%20%2B%20Explanation.pdf) where I explain my thoughts alongside the code. It's quite long so here are some screenshots that should serve well as a TL;DR:

## [üìî Can we use meeting notes to identify the best clients?](https://github.com/harishasan001/data-sci-portfolio/blob/main/Meeting%20Notes%20Project%20_%20Haris%20Hasan.pdf) 
#### Data Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining
##### Languages/tools used: MS Azure, Excel, R

The goal was to consider what kind of insights we can get from meeting notes between the business and clients. It was important for us to figure out what kinds of words could suggest high sales potential.

We manually went through 800 comments from meeting notes over about 8 weeks, rating them in 5 different categories

Then, we used Microsoft Azure to consider the sentiment analysis and key phrases, and compare the results with what we found in our manual analysis.

Finally, we used the sales data to determine the correlation between the sales and dimension scores, and found the correlation coefficient for each of the five categories to reach our conclusions.

***Results***
<br>
We realized that Account Penetration was perhaps the most important Dimension Score because it demonstrated the greatest Correlation Coefficient

Practically this means that High Penetration phrases such as ‚ÄúMet with Dr, met with doc‚Äù, ‚ÄúMet with office manager‚Äù, ‚Äúmet with OM‚Äù, ‚ÄúInterested‚Äù, etc. can lead to greater Total Sales in the past, present and future.
