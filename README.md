#### End-to-End ML model: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Supervised Linear Regression Model
I wrote out a fully detailed report of my methods and learnings [here](https://github.com/harishasan001/data-sci-portfolio/blob/main/NYC%20Taxi%20Fare%20Prediction%20Report%20%2B%20Explanation.pdf) where I explain my thoughts alongside the code. It's quite long so here are some screenshots that should serve well as a TL;DR:

#### Data Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, Opinion Mining

Here we manually went through 800 comments from meeting notes over about 8 weeks, where each comment was
rated on a scale of 1-5 in 5 different categories (with one of the categories just being a confidence
rating)

Then, we used Microsoft Azure to look consider the sentiment analysis and key phrases, and compare the results with what we found in our manual analysis.
Azure‚Äôs analysis tended to have more positive and negative sentiments, whereas in our manual analysis we gave more mixed sentiments. Also, we found that Azure identified more key phrases that we did not identify in our analysis, but some of these words may or may not be useful depending on the context that they are used in the comment.

Finally, we used the sales data to determine the correlation between the sales and dimension scores, and found the correlation coefficient for each of the five categories to reach our conclusions.

***Results***
We realized that Account Penetration was perhaps the most important Dimension Score because it demonstrated the greatest Correlation Coefficient

Practically this means that High Penetration phrases such as ‚ÄúMet with Dr, met with doc‚Äù, ‚ÄúMet with office manager‚Äù, ‚Äúmet with OM‚Äù, ‚ÄúInterested‚Äù, etc. can lead to greater Total Sales in the past, present and future.
